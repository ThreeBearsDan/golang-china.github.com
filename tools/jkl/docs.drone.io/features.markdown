title: Need a continuous integration server?
---

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) will **build**, **test**, and **deploy** your code
within minutes.

## No Installation

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) is fully management. Sure, you could setup and host
Jenkins on an underpowered Amazon EC2 micro instance for $16 / month. Or you can use
[drone.io](https://drone.io)'s high CPU servers **starting at just $5 / month**.

## Git and More

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) works with your favorite VCS:

* Git
* Mercurial
* Bazaar
* Subversion

Which means you can use your favorite hosting service:

* Github
* Bitbucket
* Launchpad
* Google Code
* *and more*

## Free for Open Source

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) is free for open source projects. Similar to Github,
you can use a single Continuous Integration provider for both closed and open
source projects. Learm more about our [Private Plans and Pricing](https://drone.io/pricing).

## Language Support

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) virtual build machines support multiple languages
(C, C++, Dart, Go, Java, Node, Python, Ruby) and multiple databases (MySQL,
Postgres, Redis, Mongo, Memcache).

## Simple, Secure Setup

No need to learn another complex XML or YAML structure just to execute a build.
[Drone.io](https://drone.io) uses the same commands you are using to build your
project locally (ie on your laptop).

Build commands **are not** checked into your repository. This is an important
difference between [Drone.io](https://drone.io) and other providers. If your build
script requires sensitive information (ie amazon keys, database passwords) do
you really want that checked into your repository?

## Continuous Deployments

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) supports continuous deployments to Heroku and
Dotcloud, with plans to support Google App Engine, Engine Yard and more.

## And More

[Drone.io](https://drone.io) is our **full time job**. We are making improvements,
adding languages, and enhancements daily. We are confident that over the next few
months [Drone.io](https://drone.io) will emerge as the premier continuous
integration service.

So what are you waiting for. [Get started today](https://drone.io/auth/login)!
