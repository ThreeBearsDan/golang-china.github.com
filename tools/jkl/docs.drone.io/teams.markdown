**Drone** supports Github and Bitbucket organizations
out of the box. There is no extra setup. There are no additional fees. When
creating a new project you will see a list of all your repositories, both individual
and organization.

## Team Billing

If you work in a team setting, you may want to **setup a single paid plan** for
you and your team members. Once you purchase a plan, you will have the option to link your Github
and Bitbucket organizations to your account:

Once linked, your team members will be able to setup private projects
owned by (or forked from) these organizations. These projects will be
counted against your plan and quota.

NOTE: Your team members **will not** be able to modify or administer your plan
