## Amazon Key and Secret

You'll need to provide the AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key in order
for Drone to authenticate and upload files to your S3 bucket.

## Bucket

The name of your S3 bucket.

## Region

Choose the region where your bucket is located:

* us-east-1
* us-west-1
* us-west-2
* eu-west-1
* ap-southeast-1
* ap-southeast-2
* ap-northeast-1
* sa-east-1

## Access

You an choose the access level for the files being uploaded:

* private
* public-read
* public-read-write
* authenticated-read
* bucket-owner-read
* bucket-owner-full-control

Learn more about S3 access control
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ACLOverview.html#CannedACL](here).

## Source

Specify which files are getting uploaded to S3. The Source path is relative to
the root of your repository. See some common examples below:

Upload your entire repository:

```
/*
```

Upload the contents of a folder:

```
/folder/*
```

Upload the contents of a folder, including all subdirectories:

```
/folder/**
```

Upload a single file:

```
/path/to/file.txt
```

Upload files matching a pattern:

```
/folder/*/*.zip
```

## Target

Specify the base directory where the files should be uploaded. For example,
if you archive file `bar.txt` and specify the target directory `foo`, your
file will get uploaded to `/foo/bar.txt` in s3.

It is important to note that you source directory structure will not be preserved
when uploading to s3. For example, if you archive `/folder/file.txt` it will
be uploaded to `/file.txt` in s3 (with `/folder/` stripped from the path). In
order to preserve the source directory structure, you would set your target
to `/folder`.

## Branch <small>Optional</small>

If the Branch filter is empty, Drone will execute your deployment for all
branches. If you only want certain branches to automatically deploy, you can
specify them in this field as a comma-separated list.

## Limitations

During its Beta period, the following limitations will be placed
on S3 uploads:

* 1000 file max upload
* 100MB max file size
